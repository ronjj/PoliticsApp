Made for the Fall 2022 Hack Challenge.

App-one-liner: "One stop shop for all things politics"

App Description:
We plan on designing, implementing, and publishing a political news IOS application. We noticed that an increasing amount of people are interested in politics - voting numbers in the midterms at an all time high, increased polling, and generally important social and economic issues drawing more people into the world of politics. We noticed that one thing political related apps were missing was speed - most people donâ€™t want to spend hours pouring over the politics and biased media sources to get reliable information. So we decided to design the one stop shop for all things political for the average American - this means fast, unbiased, and reliable. The application will be geared with three main tabs -designed to be increasingly specific to a user. We start at the home screen which will be a map of the continental US including Hawaii and Alaska. This map will include a touch interface that will allow a user to quickly, and intuitively get a grasp of any of the news around a political representative of any state. The next tab, will include a news update about topics and representatives the user follows. We hope to make this the tab where a user can gain an understanding of all things political they are interested in in less than 5 minutes. The final tab will be a collection of news about all things local to the user. Using their zip code we will give them hot political topics of their area, what their representatives are doing in the state assembly, and their congressional representatives actions in Washington. We hope to maintain the idea of seamless design, and fast paced information transfer.
